# React Forms

Quick start:

```
$ npm install

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ npm run watch

## About

This is an example from a scrimba tutorial. I am using react to test the waters on form input with different types like text, radio buttons, option select.
